# Project Proposal: Real-time chat and call application

### What and why
I would like to build an app that has real-time text communications as well as voice and video calling capabilities. I am interested in doing such because I am inspired by apps such as Discord and Zoom and would like to get experience with building a project that has similar capabilities as well as learn how to use web sockets and build a network and backbone that allows for such an app.

### For Whom
This app is for anyone who wants to talk with others through the internet by whatever means they wish. As long as they have an internet connection and the ID and consent of whoever they want to communicate with, it can be done. In addition, the app will focus on privacy of all data to protect its users.

### How?

The app will use web sockets for end to end communication between users, who can either use the app by getting a temporary ID that allows users to anonymously create chats as well as initiate calls with others, or by creating a account that associates users with a permanent ID that has the same functionality. If they elect to create an account, users will be able to customize their profile with a custom username, profile picture, and biography. After accessing the interface and getting an ID of some form, users will be able to type, send, and recieve text messages between other users securely.

### Scope
This project isn't particularly easy because it requires the group to learn about websockets as well as whatever technologies we need to make a backbone that can handle video calling and texting between individuals and groups. It shouldn't be extremely ambitious as we will be making a small scale system that isn't designed to handle millions or even thousands of users who have storage and live connection needs. There are likely libraries out there that cover what we need for peer to peer connections and video transmission, and it would be enriching and fun to build up systems of our own if we have time after making a prototype. I am most scared of the stipulation that our app will allow users to have all of their data be secure with us, and this requirement can be dropped if it adds too much overhead.
